Description: This package provides sensitivity testing practitioners and researchers
    with an ability to conduct, analyze, and simulate various sensitivity experiments 
    involving binary responses and a single stimulus level (e.g. drug dosage, drop height,
    velocity, etc.). Included are the modern Neyer and 3pod adaptive procedures, as well as
    the Bruceton and Langlie. The latter two benchmark procedures are capable of being
    performed according to generalized up-down transformed-response rules. Each procedure
    is designated phase-one of a three-phase experiment. The goal of phase-one is to
    achieve overlapping data. The two additional (and optional) refinement phases utilize
    the D-optimal criteria and the Robbins-Monro-Joseph procedure. The goals of the two
    refinement phases are to situate testing in the vicinity of the median and tails of the 
    latent response distribution, respectively.
